# School Whistleblowing System

A simple and privacy-focused web application built with Laravel 11 to help students safely report bullying incidents at school. This system empowers students to speak up without fear of exposure or retaliation.

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this project is to provide a secure, anonymous, and user-friendly platform for students who have witnessed or experienced bullying. It is designed to:

- Protect the identity of whistleblowers
- Encourage honest and safe reporting
- Help school administrators handle reports effectively

## 🔐 Key Features

- **Anonymous Reporting**: Users can choose to submit reports anonymously or include their identity if they're comfortable.
- **Auto-generated Usernames**: During registration, usernames are randomly generated to protect user identity.
- **Detailed Reporting**: Users can file reports specifying the incident, perpetrator information, and their role (victim/witness).
- **User Dashboard**: Logged-in users can view, edit, and delete their own reports.
- **Admin Panel**: Admins can view full report details, mark them as handled, and delete irrelevant or invalid reports.
- **Role-based Access**: Only registered users can submit reports, and only admins can manage them.
